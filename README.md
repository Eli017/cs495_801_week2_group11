# Alan Bauer

This summer I spent a lot of time working on personal projects using the MERN stack. When I was not working,
I spent time with family. I spent most of my free time playing video games with friends.

# Eli Sokeland

This summer I interned at DeveloperTown doing Xamarin and React development. When I wasn't working, I spent
my time walking the Indianapolis canal and playing Fall Guys.

# Nathan Malitz

This summer I got certified as a cloud practitioner for AWS as part of an internship.
I was also a student in CS410 (Web Programming), which went pretty smoothly in my opinion.
During my freetime I up kept my journal of playlists I've been keeping for around three years now.

# Nick D'Agostino

This summer I had an internship lined up with the Chicago fast food chain Portillos, however that was cancelled by COVID-19.
I instead spent the summer working at a local pizza place and playing guitar hero.

# James Shallcross

This summer, I worked on personal projects while trying to get school sorted out for the year and looked for internships. 
COVID-19 definitely made the summer less fun. Had a few summer classes I had to take also that went pretty well.
