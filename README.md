This summer I spent a lot of time working on personal projects using the MERN stack. When I was not working,
I spent time with family. I spent most of my free time playing video games with friends.

This summer I interned at DeveloperTown doing Xamarin and React development. When I wasn't working, I spent
my time walking the Indianapolis canal and playing Fall Guys.

This summer I got certified as a cloud practitioner for AWS as part of an internship.
I was also a student in CS410 (Web Programming), which went pretty smoothly in my opinion.
During my freetime I up kept my journal of playlists I've been keeping for around three years now.
